## Further development

- Need to resole issue that doesn't allow tasks to be dropped into a list after it's become empty.

- Unitlize react-beautiful-dnd to improve drag and drop functionality and replace current code

- Make the size of the div fit to the content inside rather than all 3 columns always being the same size.

- General styling updates
